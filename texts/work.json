Along the way, we've built several great web applications for our clients, developed some juicy apps of our own, taught workshops, organized really cool events (Railscamps, Nodecamp etc.), and met a bunch of great people.  Our work flow follows the principles of agile software development, which includes daily calls, honest retrospectives, and a story-driven planning process. We work closely with our clients to deliver awesome web applications. But see for yourself...\nHave a project we can help bring to life? We're ready for service: team@railslove.com"
