    "description": "Manuel is a 17-year-old guy, who loves seeing and writing elegant, clean and DRY code. He loves developing and playing with juicy, fresh and powerful libraries and is open for trying new stuff all the time. He thinks that every programming language(well, most of them) have their purpose but that ruby serves most of his needs at the moment and looks beautiful at it.",
