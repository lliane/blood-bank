    "about": "Although Paul fell in love with programming at an early age, he set out on the quest to untangle the ultimate code - NL (natural language) - in the forms of literature and philosophy. He's highly versed in deconstructing anything from Shakespeare to Heidegger and will be glad to discuss the textuality of (literary) hypertexts. Nevertheless, Paul always maintained a strong interest in web technology and mathematics. We're excited he has now decided to make Rails his fulltime project and to head our Ruby poetry department."
