    "description": "Well, Tatjana knows nothing about developing or programming stuff and she doesn't even like computers. Even though she never fell in love with any programming language she thinks \"ruby-on-rails\" is a funny word. What she does like is Chinese (at least the food) which she studied in cologne and shanghai along with business administration.",
