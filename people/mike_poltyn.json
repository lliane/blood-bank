    "description": "From one-liners to big applications, whether it comes to Ruby, PHP or JavaScript, there is not much Mike has not learnt over past 6 years. Doing mostly backend, he is capable of creating a system that does the most complicated stuff, while retaining its simple usage. Personally, he is an HTML5, CSS3 and&nbsp;JavaScript freak. Mike was involved in multiple open-source projects, including MediaWiki (wiki engine powering Wikipedia).<br/><br/>Privately, an addicted <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/id/holek\">gamer</a>, karaoke singer and a pub crawler who loves cities of Cologne and Wrocław.",
