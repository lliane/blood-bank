    "about": "A young jQuery padawan and an old PHP master. Started out as a freelancer back in 2005, since then learned a great deal about PHP and was working on a couple of open-source projects, including MediaWiki (powering Wikipedia). Thus, he made his way to Railslove, where he became a Railslover himself. Privately, he is a Ubuntu user and addicted gamer, and he loves the vista of the Baltic Sea.",
