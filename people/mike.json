    "description": "From one-liners to big applications, whether it comes to Ruby, PHP or JavaScript, there's not much Mike hasn't learnt over past 6 years. Doing mostly backend, he is capable of creating a system that does the most complicated stuff, while retaining its simple use. Personally, he's a HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript freak. Mike was involved with multiple open-source projects, including MediaWiki (wiki engine powering Wikipedia).
