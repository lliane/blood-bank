Thanks to the mad Backbone.js skills of Mathias Schäfer, people now can enjoy a whole new and highly interactive moviepilot.com - and developers are invited to use <a href='https://github.com/moviepilot/chaplin'>Chaplin</a>, a sample application architecture Mathias et al. built on top of Backbone.js.",
