Afterwards we joined forces again and developed the first iterations based on Backbone.js. Thanks to the following mad Backbone skills of Mathias Schäfer, people now can enjoy a whole new experience of movie entertainment on moviepilot.com and developers are invited start building their applications based on <a href='https://github.com/moviepilot/chaplin'>Chaplin</a> - a well-designed application architecture using Backbone.js.",
